This directory contains files for the performance test of DAMON.

The test measures the runtime and memory footprint of 25 workloads in PARSEC3
and SPLASH-2X benchmark suites with different kernel configurations.  The
configurations are as below:

    orig	Original kernel running THP with 'madvise()' enable policy
    rec		Kernel running DAMON with record option for the workloads
    thp		Original kernel running THP with 'always' enable policy
    ethp	Kernel running 'efficient THP' operation scheme.
