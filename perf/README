This directory contains files for the performance test of DAMON.

The test measures the runtime and memory footprint of 25 workloads in
PARSEC3[1] and SPLASH-2X[2] benchmark suites with different kernel
configurations.  The configurations are as below:

    orig	Original kernel running THP with 'madvise()' enable policy
    rec		Kernel running DAMON with record option for the workloads
    thp		Original kernel running THP with 'always' enable policy
    ethp	Kernel running 'efficient THP' operation scheme.
    prcl	Kernel running 'proactive reclamation' operation scheme.

Pre-requisites
==============

lazybox
-------

The tests are using lazybox[1], a toolset for various cases.  You should place
it at '$HOME/lazybox'.  For example:

    $ cd $HOME; git clone https://github.com/sjp38/lazybox

parsec3_on_ubuntu
-----------------

For more easier and automated use of the target workloads in PARSEC3 and
SPLASH-2X, the tests use another wrapper for the benchmark suites, called
parsec3_on_ubuntu[1].  You should first place it at '$HOME/parsec3_on_ubuntu'.
For example:

    $ cd $HOME; git clone https://github.com/sjp38/parsec3_on_ubuntu

After that, you should follow the instructions in the README in the project to
install PARSEC3 and SPLASH-2X workloads.  For example, if you are on Ubuntu
18.04:

    $ cd $HOME/parsec3_on_ubuntu
    $ ./getsrc.sh; ./patch-for-ubntu-xenial.sh; ./intall_dep-xenial.sh;
    $ ./build.sh; ./build.sh splash2x

Python3
-------

Lazybox depends on Python3.  Install it using your package manager.  However,
most python scripts in the lazybox are python2 compatible.   You could try
changing the shebangs to python2.


gnuplot
-------

Visualization of the outputs in the reports are made using 'gnuplot'.  Install
it using your package manager.


TL; DR
======

Just sequentially execute below three commands.

    $ ./run.sh
    $ ./post.sh
    $ ./pr_report.sh
